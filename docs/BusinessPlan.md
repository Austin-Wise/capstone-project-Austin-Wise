# Revenue

## Ticker Tape will make money by...


*If you plan to make it free, explain why this is a sensible decision. Note that ad-supported or freemium apps are not free. If you are going to make your app a paid service, explain how much and in what way (subscriptions, one-time costs, etc.) this fee will be collected.*

## My competitors

### Feedly:
Uses a three tier freemium model.

   - Free: allowing up to 3 channels and 100 sources, has sponsored ads and operates slower than the other tiers.
   - Pro: Unlimited channels and sources, allows notes and highlights, as well as 7 additional features.
   - Teams: Allows research and sharing of industry trends, Pro featues, as well as 9 additional features.
   
#### How Consumers Feel:
   Browsing a few Reddit feeds, I noticed that although Feedly seems to market their paid plans tastefully, they are driving away traffic by throttling site potential. Other services have emerged offering Feedly's Pro options for FREE, while using paid banner ads as a source of revenue. Consumers appear to prefer this option.

### Facebook:
Utilizes consumer data for targeting advertisements displayed throughout the site.

#### How Consumers Feel:
  Consumers are concerned about their privacy within Facebook, with fear that their data is being sold. Though the site does not directly sell consumer data, it is used internally for increasing effectiveness of third-party advertisements on the site. Though consumers enjoy that Facebook is free to use, they do not appreciate the tactics Facebook is using.

### T.D.Ameritrade: 
   As T.D.Ameritrade is a brokerage firm, revenue is seen from brokerage fees, lending interest, and commission. The news portion is free for investors, funded by other portions of the site.
   
#### How Consumers Feel:

Though investors keep updated on current events digitally, T.D.Amertrade users typically do not stay within the site to keep up-to-date. The site is too hard to navigate for convenience. Many options, such as Investor's Business Daily - have subscription-based services to provide to these users more conveniently.

### (Apple) News:

Apple News operates with advertisements. This is interesting, as on first look, advertisements are few and far between. Further study suggested that advertisers tend to avoid paying to advertise on the Apple News platform because of this reason. Adversly, publishers are stating that Apple News is now driving more refferrals than Facebook (Mark,2019)

#### How Consumers Feel:

Viewership for Apple News has grown in the last few years, and this is partly due to trust in the platform. Having a hard time finding an advertisement when you are -looking- for one, speaks in volume to their success with their audience.

### Flipboard: 

Flipboard has a range of monotization streams, including a shopping section and full-page advertisements that are shown once in every ten pages the viewer sees.

#### How Consumers Feel:

Flipboard has been around for almost ten years with success. Advertisers enjoy the application just as users do, as while reading, the advertisement does not crowd the screen. Swiping past the ad is simple and non-intrusive.

## Projected income
*Given your projected target audience (from week 1), how much are you likely to make? Think about their income level and how much they would be willing to spend. Also think about how broad the audience is if your project only reaches a smaller set of the population, you are less likely as many users a project that has broad appeal, which impacts the projected income.*

*Is your projected income enough to make it worth developing the project? Is there some other reason to build the app outside of revenue? If the answer is no to both those questions, reach out to your instructor because it might be better to make something else that will keep you engaged.*

# Marketing

## Elevator Pitch

*An elevator pitch is a couple of short sentences that illustrate your problem, solution, and unique value. Think of being stuck in an elevator with someone in your target audience, and you only have till the ground floor to show them the value of your product. What would you say? What would you say to your aunt when she asks you about your project?*
