## 1. Target Market



### 1.1 Analysis of Complementary Product
Robinhood, a popular commission-free trading app amongst Gen-Y and Z users - average age of 32, has a user base now surpassing E-Trade (Reddy, 2019). This mobile-friendly, commission-free method of investing focuses less on tooling and more on ease-of-use.

### 1.2 Demographic Study

*~30% of American adults have non-retirement investment accounts.*

According to a 2018 NFCS FinTech-related study:
>"Younger respondents, those with higher incomes, and non-White respondents are more likely to use technology to help with personal financial management."

Primary factors for this analysis contain two categories: Use of websites/apps for financial tasks, Spending less than Income. Financial Well-Being scores are seen as a secondary factor.

#### Websites / App use for financial tasks

##### Age
    - 56% between 18 and 34
    - 42% between 35 and 54
    - 23% among 55+
##### Ethnicity
    - 51% African American
    - 49% Hispanic
    - 34% White
    - 45% Asian American
    - 41% Other

#### Spending Less than Income
##### By Education Level
    - 36% HS or Less
    - 38% Some College
    - 50% College or More

##### By Ethnicity (2018)
    - 34% African American
    - 39% Hispanic
    - 42% White
    - 46% Asian American

#### Financial Well-Being Score
(Financial Well-Being score is correlated with overall satisfaction with personal finances, and inversely correlated with financial difficulty)

##### By Age
    - 48%  18-34
    - 49%  35-54
    - 59%  55+

##### By Income
    - 44%  <$25k
    - 51%  $25-75k
    - 59%  $75k+

### 1.3 Target Summary
As **APP** will be seen as a complementary product to services such as Robinhood, the mean age will be a contributing factor to **APP**'s target age.

Additional findings cited from the 2018 National Financial Capital Study suggest Hispanic and Asian American individuals between as target ethnicities, as they not only spend less than income, but are also most likely to use websites and applications for financial tasks. 

In terms of age group and education level, **APP** will be marketed towards college educated individuals between 21 and 34, where focus is skewed left.

Target income follows loosely towards $25-75k, as the financial well-being score naturally progresses as income increases.

Individuals with African American and White ethnicity, as well as  individuals between 25 and 54 follow as Secondary markets, as their scores are satisfactory in terms of "Website / Application use for financial purposes" __or__ "Spending Less than Income". Though individuals above 55 have satisfactory scores for financial well-being, this age group scores very poorly within the "Website / Application Use" criteria and is not considered as a secondary market.

## User Profile

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*

## Use Cases

*Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your user’s experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used.*

*Use Cases will help to drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. Regularly testing as if you were a user following a use case throughout the project development lifecycle will provide valuable insight into how your application is addressing the needs of the user and allow you to correct missteps early.*

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

## Key Features

*Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here.*

## Integrations

*Identify what 3rd party APIs, data sets, or external integrations are planned for use and outline how you will use them transformatively. Provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*
